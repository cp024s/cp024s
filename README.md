### <div align = center> RTL · SoC Design · Verification Engineer </div>

I design **hardware that survives verification**, and verify **hardware that deserves tapeout**.

I work at the intersection of **RTL microarchitecture**, **protocol correctness**, and **verification rigor** — translating specifications into clean, synthesizable logic and proving it works under real constraints.

---


## What I Actually Do

- Architect RTL blocks with **clear microarchitecture & FSM discipline**
- Write **synthesizable, timing-aware RTL**
- Build **self-checking verification environments**
- Validate **protocol compliance**, not just happy paths
- Debug failures using **waveforms, assertions, and specs**
- Document assumptions, trade-offs, and limitations

I care about **why a design works**, not just that it simulates.

## Featured Work

### **100 Days of RTL**
🔗 https://github.com/cp024s/100-days-of-RTL

A disciplined RTL engineering initiative focused on **depth, not demos**.

What this project demonstrates:
- incremental RTL complexity with architectural intent
- consistent coding style & naming discipline
- verification-first mindset
- documentation of **design decisions, assumptions, and edge cases**

This is **practice for real IP development**, not tutorial recycling.

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- RTL is a **liability** unless verified properly  
- Specs are meaningless unless **interpreted precisely**  
- Coverage without intent is **false confidence**  
- Debug skill matters more than tool familiarity  

I don’t chase tools.  
I chase **correctness**.
