# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I'm currently working on RTL Deign (verilog, System Verilog, UVM)<br><br>👬 I'm looking to collaborate with people with same ideas of myself, developing projects on Verilog and VHDL<br><br>

🌱 Im currently Gaining knowledge on Advanced digital design, Static timing analysis, Verilog HDL, FPGA architecture, CMOS fundamentals, Perl scripting, RISC V processor, ASIC verification methods, System verilog, Verification planning, Assertion based verification, Universal verification method and DFT. <br><br>

💭 Ask/Talk to me about #RTLdesign #digitaldesign #socdesign #verification <br><br>

⚡Fun Fact: The name "Verilog" is a portmanteau of the words "verification" and "logic." This is because Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) that is used to describe digital systems at the register transfer level (RTL). RTL is the level of abstraction where data is transferred between registers, and Verilog is used to describe the logic that controls this data transfer!  🧮💻👩‍💼

# My Academic project Repos
### [Dowsiness Detection System)](https://github.com/cp024s/DDS) <br>
The "Drowsiness Detection System" project uses Python to analyze a person's facial features through a camera feed, detecting signs of drowsiness and alerting them in real-time to prevent potential accidents. This system employs computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to monitor eye closure patterns and trigger alerts when fatigue is detected. <br>
Tech Stack used : Python, Node RED <br>

### [Smart Pesticide Sprayer (Arduino and Other Hardware components)](https://github.com/cp024s/Smart-pesiticide-sprayer)
Developed a prototype model to minimize the labour requirements and to increase crop productivity by automatically spraying herbicides throughout the field. <br>
Software used: Blynk, Arduino IDE <br>
Hardware used: ESP8266, ESP32-CAM, L298N motor driver, various sensors. <br>

### [Standalone Fire extinguisher (Arduino and Other Hardware components)](https://github.com/cp024s/Standalone-fire-Extinguisher) <br><br>


### [RFID Attendance management System (Arduino and Other Hardware components)](https://github.com/cp024s/RFID-attendance-management)
Designed a real time attendance management system by employing an RF system operated in the 433 MHz frequency range. As a result the attendance is stored in a memory device along with the Time stamp. <br>
Software used: Arduino IDE <br>
Hardware used: AtMega328p, MRFC522 RF receiver, LCD i2c display, SD card module, RTC module. <br>
