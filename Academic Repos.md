### [Dowsiness Detection System](https://github.com/cp024s/DDS) <br>
The "Drowsiness Detection System" project uses Python to analyze a person's facial features through a camera feed, detecting signs of drowsiness and alerting them in real-time to prevent potential accidents. This system employs computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to monitor eye closure patterns and trigger alerts when fatigue is detected. <br>
Tech Stack used : Python, Node RED <br>

### [Smart Pesticide Sprayer](https://github.com/cp024s/Smart-pesiticide-sprayer)
Developed a prototype model to minimize the labour requirements and to increase crop productivity by automatically spraying herbicides throughout the field. <br>
Software used: Blynk, Arduino IDE <br>
Hardware used: ESP8266, ESP32-CAM, L298N motor driver, various sensors. <br>

### [Standalone Fire extinguisher](https://github.com/cp024s/Standalone-fire-Extinguisher)
A 3d printed standalone fire extinguisher which senses fire and try to extinguish by spraying water. Consists of two servo motors for axis movement and a pump for spraying water which is controlled by Arduino. The sensor part include 4 flame sensors, 2 Smoke sensors and a IP camera for the footage view. <br>

### [RFID Attendance management System](https://github.com/cp024s/RFID-attendance-management)
Designed a real time attendance management system by employing an RF system operated in the 433 MHz frequency range. As a result the attendance is stored in a memory device along with the Time stamp. <br>
Software used: Arduino IDE. <br>
Hardware used: AtMega328p, MRFC522 RF receiver, LCD i2c display, SD card module, RTC module. <br>

### [Radar system using Arduino and Processing](https://github.com/cp024s/Radar-Arduino)
Developed a cutting-edge radar system utilizing Arduino for hardware integration and Processing for real-time data visualization. <br>
Software used: Arduino IDE,Processing. <br>
Hardware used: AtMega328p, HC SR-04, Servo motor. <br>
